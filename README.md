# Guidelines to successful collaboration with a comptuational biologist in single-cell analysis


1. *Early communication*: agreement to study design, sequencing plans, and data analysis strategy by the whole team BEFORE any data generation is performed. 
2. *Provide all metadata*: provide all biological and technical covariates (e.g., sample conditions, patient characteristics, batch, processing date, etc) before any analysis is begun.
3. *Regular meetings from investigators across disciplines*: minimal bi-weekly meetings between trainees from each discipline, with monthly meetings for the entire study team including both computational and biology PIs.
4. *Expectations of computational PI*: select and explain analysis methodology, adjusting to fundamental hypotheses of the experiment; generate tables and figures associated with all analyses; provide reproducible scripts for analysis and support depositing data to public domain
5. *Expectations of biology PI*: obtain appropriate IRB permissions for genomic data sharing prior to sequencing (for human studies); provide marker genes for relevant cell types and annotations of genes found through comptuational analyses; provide clear biological hypotheses to guide steps of the computational analysis
